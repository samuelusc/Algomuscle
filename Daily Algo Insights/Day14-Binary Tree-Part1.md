## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Have a look at an elementary example of a binary tree:

### Depth of a Node

The length of the path from a node, n, to the root node. The depth of the root node is 0.

### Height of a Tree 

The length of the path from n to its deepest descendant. The height of the tree itself is the height of the root node, and the height of leaf nodes is always 0.

### Full, Complete and Perfect Binary Trees

**Full binary tree**

Every node has 0 or 2 children.

**Complete Binary tree**

In a complete binary tree, every level except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

**Perfect binary tree**

All internals nodes have two children and all leaf nodes have the same level.

### Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree, in which every nodes follows the ordering property of all left descendents < node < all right descendents.
