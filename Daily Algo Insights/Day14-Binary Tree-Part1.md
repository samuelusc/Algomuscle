## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Have a look at an elementary example of a binary tree:

## Depth of a Node

The length of the path from a node, n, to the root node. The depth of the root node is 0.

## Height of a Tree 

The length of the path from n to its deepest descendant. The height of the tree itself is the height of the root node, and the height of leaf nodes is always 0.

## Full, Complete and Perfect Binary Trees

### Full Binary Tree

Every node has 0 or 2 children.

### Complete Binary Tree

In a complete binary tree, every level except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

### Perfect Binary Tree

All internals nodes have two children and all leaf nodes have the same level.


## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree, in which every nodes follows the ordering property of all left descendents < node < all right descendents.

## Tree Traversal 

![Tree Traversal](https://github.com/samuelusc/Algomuscle/blob/main/assets/Day14/traverse.jpg)

### In-order Traversal: [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H]

In-order traversal visits the left branch first, then the current node, and finally the right branch. The diagram below shows the traversal order of an in-order traversal on a binary tree.

### Pre-order Traversal: [F,B,A,D,C,E,G,H]

Pre-order traversal visits the current node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. The diagram below shows the traversal order of a pre-order traversal on a binary tree.

### Post-order Traversal [A,C,E,D,B,H,G,F]

Post-order traversal visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the current node. The diagram below shows the traversal order of a post-order traversal on a binary tree.
